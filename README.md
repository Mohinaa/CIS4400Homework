# Vehicle Collisions in NYC: Tracking Accidents to Enhance Safety
Have you ever witnessed an accident and wondered if everyone was okay and if there was a way it could have been prevented? That's been my concern since I saw a highway accident involving a motorcyclist.

Additionally, having worked at a TLC Brokerage, I was responsible for analyzing the accidents involving our drivers. This experience piqued my interest in safety. I sought out open-source data specifically reporting on accidents in NYC, focusing on collisions that impacted pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists.

1. Business Problem
   
NYC has a lot of reckless drivers, especially during certain hours of the day or certain seasons. To make it safe for everyone I tried creating a data warehouse to analyze which boroughs have the most accident, the time of day, and how many cars. 

2. Business Impact
   
Understanding and knowing about the data for this project would help New Yorkers be safe drivers and know which areas to be extra cautious of. 

3. Business Persona

Dine Safe is designed for everyone, particularly drivers who care about their safety, parents, and even elderly who drive and want to be careful. 

4. Data

We gathered data from NYC Open Source Data on all the accidents that happened in NYC. 

5. Methods

At the core of my operation lies a sophisticated tech stack designed to extract actionable insights from raw data. Utilizing tools like DbSchema, I processed and ingested data with precision and efficiency. I used Datagrip to load my schemas and tried to clean and reformat my data so I could push it to Postgres

6. Data Tools
- Data Storage: Azure Cloud Storage

- Data Processing: Python Script to process/ingest the data
  
- Data Orchestration: DataGrip for creating my schemas
   
- Data warehouse: Postgres for our data warehouse
  
- Data Visualization: Tableau for our visualizations
